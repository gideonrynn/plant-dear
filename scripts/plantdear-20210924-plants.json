Once they bolt in late spring or early summer, the bloom stalks may grow 24 to 36 inches with (edible!) tan-white flowers on top, which signals that it is time to make room for warm-weather crops. However, some gardeners continue to harvest the leaves even from the tall plants, liking the stronger taste. You can even cut them back and pick some more until you finally tire of that and then pull them up and wait until fall to plant again."

    "description" : "If you are repotting in the same size container, you must ensure that as much of the old soil as possible is discarded without harming the root structure. Fill the new container with all-purpose tropical soil/peat mix, transfer the plant, and water it lightly.\n\nIf you decide to use a larger container, it should be 1.5 times the previous size or more. For example: if the original pot diameter was 4 inches, then the new one should be at least 6 inches! Transfer your Pilea directly into the larger container with the old soil undisturbed, but make sure there is enough new soil to fill the container. \n\nWhen overwatered, the Pilea's leaves will develop brown spotting and edging, and the leaves will begin to fall off the plant. If your plant is showing these symptoms, feel the soil. If it’s moist then hold off on watering until the soil dries all the way through the pot. Reference the care instructions for re-establishing a watering routine with your plant. Other causes for brown spotting are too much fertilizer, too much sun, or pests.",

    "notes" : "9/20/21: repotted in big pot. used mostly succulent mix, some regular potting soil, bark, perlite. Also read that new leaves curl when they need more water. Watered it a couple days ago on Thursday and the new leave straightened out a bit, and watered the top of it today since I added more soil. Will see what happens to it with the repot.\n\nI have more than one of these. A small one I picked up from Trader Joe's, and has gotten bigger over time. A larger one I picked up from Target.\n\nKnown to be finicky. As long as the water schedule is consistent, it seem to be pretty happy. \n\n8/10/21: I put the smaller one under the newer full spectrum grow lights two weeks ago and it seems happy, producing new leaves quickly. However, the bottom leaves suddenly started getting yellow and dropping, and I think that's because I started going further between waterings. Will try to water every 5 days and see how that goes.\n\n8/5/21: a bunch of old leaves are turning yellow and dropping off. keep an eye on it. ",

    "description" : "These plants are native to tropical parts of Africa, where they thrive in very warm and wet conditions. This makes them somewhat challenging for the home grower, who is likely to have trouble duplicating these steamy conditions. However, they are relatively tough plants that can withstand a less-than-perfect environment for a fairly long time.\n\nFiddle-leaf figs are not especially demanding plants as long as you can get their growing conditions right. When grown as a houseplant, be prepared to rotate your fiddle-leaf fig every few days so a different part faces the light source. That way, it will grow evenly, rather than lean toward the light.\n\nAlso, every week or two dust the leaves with a damp cloth. Not only does this make the leaves appear shinier and more appealing, but it also allows more sunlight to hit the leaves for photosynthesis. Moreover, you can trim off any damaged or dead leaves as they arise, as they no longer benefit the plant. And if you wish, you can prune off the top of the main stem for a bushier growth habit.",

Avoid using soil mixes that contain a large amount of perlite or fertilizers containing superphosphate with these plants. That's because Dracaenas are very sensitive to fluoride, which perlite and superphosphate contain. Can water with distilled water. In terms of lighting, the ideal location for this plant indoors is near a window with filtered sunlight. Too little light will result in the leaves losing their stripes, and it can cause the plant's growth to become stunted. But direct sun can burn the plant and cause it to wilt. Outdoors, the plant does best in part shade.\n\n8/19/21: still keeping it sparingly watered. like the dumb cane plant, seems to attract a lot of fungus gnats when wet. had to repot during the early summer because of it.",

When your plant’s roots show or your peace lily seems to be drinking up all its water within a few days, re-pot into a larger container.

    "description" : "Peace Lily Care\nPeace lilies are generally grown in the ground outdoors only in tropical regions such as Florida or Hawaii; elsewhere, they are grown only as potted plants. If you have potted peace lilies, you can move them outside during the summer months, but once temperatures dip, bring them back inside. When grown in pots, soil for a peace lily must be kept moist but not soggy, which will cause the leaves to turn yellow. Avoid direct sunlight, but do give them lots of bright filtered light. They like warm conditions and will react badly if exposed to temperatures below 40 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nLight\nPeace lilies are shade-loving plants in their native habitats, but when grown indoors they need plenty of filtered light, though not direct sunlight. Some varieties can withstand more light than others. Curled, pale leaves generally indicate that the plant is receiving too much light and scorched leaves indicate too much direct sun. In either case, the plant should be moved to a shadier location.\n\nSoil\nPeace lilies like a rich, loose potting soil containing plenty of organic material. These plants are native to tropical canopy conditions where the soil is rich with deteriorating plant material. Growing them as outdoor garden plants requires soil that mimics this composition.\n\nWater\nDuring the summer, water and mist peace lilies frequently because they thrive with higher humidity, such as that found in the rainforest. In winter, reduce watering but never allow the soil to dry out. If your water is highly chlorinated, use filtered water. Or, you can allow tap water to sit for several days until the chlorine evaporates out.\n\nTemperature and Humidity\nThese plants really prefer moist warmth. Avoid cold drafts and temperatures below 55 degrees Fahrenheit, because the plant will die in cold temperatures. The ideal temperature range is 65 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Spritz the leaves every week with softened or distilled water throughout the summer growing season."

    "description" : "A small yet tough and hardy species, the silver squill (Ledebouria socialis) hails from the dry savannas of South Africa. This perennial is known for being a colorful and eye-catching houseplant. It has silvery leaves with green leopard spots, as well as unique teardrop-shaped bulbs that form above the ground. The silver squill also has the ability to store moisture in its purple, bulb-like stems during times of drought.\n\nOne of the most widely cultivated bulbs, silver squills are closely related to the hyacinth and are most often sold as a houseplant. However, they can be grown as a ground cover or even in xeriscape gardens in regions with warmer climates.\n\nThough it resembles a succulent, and possesses the same drought tolerance, the silver quill isn't technically this type of plant. The silver squill is a geophytic species of a bulbous perennial plant. You can expect its structurally unique leaves to grow in a lance shape and contain both silver spots and purple on the underside. Its flowers will grow during spring, displaying pink stems and small green flowers.\n\nBeing drought-tolerant, it looks great in xeriscape gardens. Water only when the potting mixture dries out completely. "

Trim off any dead stems and pearls, as well as any stems that have lost a lot of their beads. Pruning back will help promote fuller, more compact plants. String of pearls plants propagate quite easily, and doing so is integral to the plant's continued presence in your home. To propagate, take stem cuttings that are several inches in length, and allow them to heal over (form a scab on the cut end) for a few days before replanting. Fill a small pot with succulent or cactus mix and replant the cuttings in the soil. Allow the new plants to settle for a couple of days, then give them a good watering—they should take root quickly."

Also, T. bergeri will often have several offsets growing from the base because it offsets all year round unlike T. aeranthos that is more typical of the genus and it generally offsets after the blooming cycle. This is one of the mainstay species and while it is relatively common, it blooms like clockwork every Spring and it produces a vibrantly colorful inflorescence. Hummingbirds love this plant!",

This lessens the brightness of the color at anthesis (flowering) but for those who like pastels, this is a great choice. Also, the leaves tend to be thicker and are a more olive color than than the standard T. brachycaulos.",

I did not soak it this time, but may have to start doing that.\n\n8/13/21: bought two more. still have the other baby one that isn't growing very fast.\n\n7/31/21: both of the big ones died a month or two ago. there are two babies. will water every 10 days and see if that will help them grow.\n5/17/21, noticed that some of the leaves were mushy and rotting on both. Cut all of those off. There is one leaf that looks brown in the middle of one. When I repotted it on 5/6/21, I also watered it and I think the whole thing stayed wet for too long. Repotted on 5/18/21 with more perlite, vermiculite and sand. Also, there had been two connected starfish plants and they separated cleanly while repotting. Keep an eye on it, as I'm expecting the leaf on one in the center to end up falling up, but want to make sure the rot isn't continuing. There is also a baby plant potted separately by one of the lights.\n5/19/21, one of the two died, definitely making sure I barely water this plant.\n\nGROWING INDOORS\n\nDracaena is one of our most popular houseplants due to its tolerance of pretty much any environment and extremely easy care level. These guys will take their time growing in a low light space, but will grow effortlessly if they are given a spot with more light. It's necessary for Dracaena to dry out between waterings, so only water your plant every 7-10 days.\n\n \n\nGROWING OUTDOORS\n\nDracaena make great outdoor plants, but they are not winter hardy and should be brought inside once temperatures dip below 55 degrees. Spring through Fall, keep your Dracaena in Full to Partial Shade and make sure it is not receiving any hot, direct sun. Water once your plant has had a chance to dry out, usually about once a week with moderate temperatures.",

    "description" : "Update - this is more often referred to as Vick's Plant. On the internet, there is another plant called cuban oregano that has thinner and wider leaves, though this plant does indeed also get called cuban oregano.\nCuban oregano is botanically known as Plectranthus amboinicus or its synonym Coleus amboinicus, and is an unusual member of the mint family. Cuban oregano is commonly known by many other names including Mexican mint, Spanish thyme, Indian borage, Caribbean oregano, and Broadleaf thyme. Contrary to its name, Cuban oregano is believed to have originated in India. Can be used in place of Greek oregano, though this is has a strong aroma.\n\nPlants grow between 12 and 18 inches (30.5 and 45 cm.) tall and may develop a trailing habit, making it attractive in hanging baskets. As an in-ground plant, it will spread to a small mounded ground cover. Cuban oregano growing requirements are somewhat different than traditional oreganos, as they may burn in full sun and perform better in some light shade.\n\nhttps://gardenerspath.com/plants/herbs/grow-cuban-oregano/\n",

Large root system.\n\nPruning back hard in the spring, or after flowering is finished for the year, will ensure beautiful bushy plants that can provide an appealing border in the flower garden or a nice splash of color in the middle of an herb garden. The plant averages about 18 inches high, with a similar width.\n\nAs a shrubby perennial, Hyssop can be clipped into a low hedge, worked into a knot-garden or rock garden, planted in containers or window boxes (large enough to accommodate a robust root system), or just allowed to fly free. Trim back established hyssop plants heavily in early spring to prevent them from becoming too woody and spindly. Cutting back the foliage also encourages bushier plants.",

    "description" : "The tea tree plant (Melaleuca alternifolia) is an evergreen shrub or small tree native to Australia. Considered easy to grow outdoors in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 9 through 11, this tropical plant can be grown indoors as well with a bit of extra effort. Tea trees typically produce wispy white blooms in the spring and summer, but may not do so when grown indoors. The plants are sometimes capable of self-pollination, but rely on insect pollinators as well. Your plant may not flower unless you set it outdoors during warm weather, so insects can access it. When working with this plant, remember that, although it has many health benefits when properly processed, raw tea tree oil is toxic, and the plant should be grown well out of the reach of children.\n\nPlant the tea tree in a container of well-drained potting soil that is slightly larger than what you think it needs. Tea trees grown indoors need lots of water, and the bigger the container, the more forgiving the tree will be if you forget a watering.",

Still looks pretty ragged.\n\nOrdered from VividRoot on Etsy. Arrived on June 11 with the majority of the plant yellow. I'm being sent another one that's I'll get on June 22, going to see if I can rehab this one.\n\nCRASSULA DAVID\nCrassula are succulent, herbaceous plants. Some varieties are suitable for rock gardens in mild regions as long as the soil is well drained. The thick leaves are often covered with hair or 'meal' and the flowers are generally small in size and borne on terminal panicles. Crassulas can easily be grown from leaf cuttings. 'David' - this is a carpet forming green vigorous plant. An ideal wall or basket succulent.\n\n\nPROPAGATION BY CUTTINGS\nFROM EARLY SPRING TO LATE SUMMER\nCrassulas can be grown from leaf cuttings taken in spring and summer. Pull a leaf from the main stem, leave it to dry for a day, then place it on the surface of the growing compost. The leaf will form roots and eventually, a small rosette will appear at the base. Remove and pot up the new plant when well rooted.\n\n \nPLANTING\nFROM EARLY SPRING TO EARLY SUMMER\nCrassulas need a sharply drained soil, such as 2 parts John Innes potting compost number 2 and 1 part course sand or grit. They do best on a sunny window ledge and in winter, require a minimum temperature of 7C. Repot every second year in early spring.\n",

    "notes" : "Purchased as a baby from Trader Joe's a year or so ago. Was not labelled. Guessing elephant bush.\n\nhttps://www.succulentsandsunshine.com/types-of-succulents/portulacaria-afra-elephant-bush/\n\nTrue to its name, elephant bush is a favorite food of elephants in South Africa. You can grow it outdoors if you live in a warm climate that occasionally dips to no lower than 30 degrees Fahrenheit. If you live in a colder climate you can grow elephant bush as an easy-care house plant.\n\nThis drought-tolerant jade plant look-alike has unusual reddish-brown stems that contrast beautifully with the glossy, rounded, variegated, ¾-inch fleshy leaves. It is a slow grower, but as the stems mature they thicken so the plant takes on an old appearance even when young. Elephant bush has a somewhat sprawling/cascading habit, making it well suited to growing in a hanging basket. When grown in the ground it can slowly attain a height of several feet, and its evergreen nature makes it useful as a screen or hedge.\n\nElephant Bush Care\nHold the watering can! Like most succulents, elephant bush thrives on neglect. Just plant it in full sun in sandy soil so it dries quickly and the roots don’t rot. If you are growing it in a pot, be sure the container has a drainage hole at the bottom so the water drains out. If you have a saucer below the pot, it’s critical to empty the saucer after watering so the plant does not stand in water because they absolutely hate wet feet. Use a commercial cactus mix to pot up the plant, or make your own by combining half potting soil with half sand or vermiculite.\n\nElephant Bush Spacing\nIn the ground or in a pot, elephant bush grows slowly so it won’t overtake whatever space you give it. In the ground, it slowly reaches a few feet tall and wide but can be kept smaller by pruning the tips. If you want the plant to attain full size, leave a space of two feet around it, but beware that it is very slow growing; you might want to fill in with other small plants as it matures, then remove them as things become crowded. A grouping of elephant bush planted in the ground can be nestled as close as a foot apart so they appear as one massed plant. The size of container-grown elephant bush can be controlled by pinching the longest stems and keeping it contained to a small pot. If it becomes pot-bound, simply remove it from the pot and put it in a bigger pot, or vertically slice off part of the plant and roots; the slice can be potted up and enjoyed as an additional houseplant.",

    "notes" : "A dense mound of finely toothed, silver-grey foliage and beautiful, long, slender, dark purple flower spikes. Very tolerant of heat, sun, and periodic drought. Ideal for sunny perennial borders or rock gardens, and raised beds or containers. In colder climates, overwinter potted plants indoors until spring, after danger of frost. Evergreen. According to Gethsemane, 24-36\" tall. Unlike most garden lavenders, Goodwin Creek grows well indoors with a sunny south facing window. Hybrid of French Lavender with shorter growth habit and a darker purple flower. Great choice for perfume and culinary uses.\n\nWhile it is difficult to grow lavender indoors, largely because it can so easily fall victim to humidity and fungus, this variety tends to fare better inside than most. When growing Goodwin Creek Grey lavender indoors, make sure to plant it in well-draining soil and to give it lots of light. At the very least, it should be placed in a bright window that receives six to eight hours of sunlight per day. Alternatively, it can be grown under artificial lights. Growing Goodwin Creek Grey lavender is very similar to growing other lavender varieties, with a few exceptions. As mentioned above, it is a bit more amenable to being grown in pots indoors. It is also a little more heat resistant than other lavenders. It is very drought tolerant and does not need to be watered regularly. It should be planted in well-draining, sandy soil in a spot that receives full sun. After flower stems have faded, cut them off at the base. The whole plant can be cut back after all flowers have faded to maintain a compact, dense shape.",

    "description" : "Too much water can kill the plant so keep in mind when this is outside. This lovely herb compliments our lemon thyme, with a citrus orange peel scent, and can be planted and used in much the same way.\n\nIn common with all the other thymes it likes lots of sunshine and a poor dry soil, these conditions give the best flavours and flowers, too much water can kill the plant. Of all the thymes, the pale pink flowers of orange thyme are the first to open in early summer and are soon covered in bees and early butterflies.\n\nIt is very versatile and can be planted in herb gardens and borders, rockeries and on the edge of paths. It works well planted with pale flowered dwarf lavenders such as the white Edelweiss or Rosea - the pink variety. It can also be planted with other thymes, both upright and creeping, to give a fragrant and colourful carpet throughout the year.\n\nThe whole plant is fragrant, both the fine leaves and the pink flowers are scented with orange and can be picked and dried as sprigs to add to pot pourri.\n\nAs well as perfuming the garden and the home, this is a great thyme to use in cooking. It can be used in the same way as other culinary thymes and is particularly good with fish, soups and stews, also in sweet dishes, herb teas and fruity chutney.\n\nIf you want to preserve your orange thyme then it is best to harvest before flowering for the best flavour and aroma. Cut small bunches early in the day and dry in a warm dark place. Keep the whole leaves in jars and only crush just before use.\n\nTrim back in fall to 1 inch above previous year’s growth.",

    "description" : "Moss rose plants (Portulaca grandiflora) are popular flowering annuals sold at garden centers in the spring. And if you see leftover moss rose plants on clearance sale in the summer, you might notice the plants are usually just as lovely as they were in the spring, a testament to the plant's toughness. The medium green, cylindrical, succulent leaves of moss rose are another clue to the plant's hardiness, namely its tolerance of drought conditions.\n\nThese plants grow 3 to 9 inches tall and spread to create a dense mat, making moss rose a good option as a ground cover. The flowers come in several bright colors and often have ruffled petals, looking very similar to miniature roses. The blooms grow in clusters on reddish stems and typically don't open on cloudy days or at night. Moss rose is easy and quick to grow and is best planted in the spring after the danger of frost has passed.",

    "description" : "In USDA hardiness zones 8 to 10, eucalyptus can grow into trees of towering heights. For the home gardener, however, eucalyptus is more often grown as a potted shrub or plant. While the plant is highly adaptable to most soils, the main concern is to pay close attention to basic feeding, sunlight, and watering needs.\n\nEucalyptus is fairly free of any major pest or disease issues, though you may occasionally spot issues like eucalyptus long-horned borers, which can be treated by removing the infested area of the plant immediately (insecticides are not effective against borers).\n\nEucalyptus likes a lot of light, so settle your plant somewhere in your landscape that receives at least 8 to 10 hours of bright sunlight daily. Likewise, eucalyptus plants grown indoors should be kept near a window that gets plentiful sunlight.\n\nWater your eucalyptus plant with some regularity. While it can be considered partially drought-tolerant once established, it really doesn't like to be left dry for long periods and may even begin to drop leaves or branches.",

Figs still growing slowly.\n\n8/19/21: started growing figs about a week ago. still check it every day to see if it needs to be watered. The leaves naturally stick up, so when they start to bend over, it's clear the plant needs to be watered pretty thoroughly.\n\n8/1/21: seems to be doing well. I have to check the soil every couple days. When it looks mostly dry, I water it thoroughly. I also have to look out for powdery mildew. I think when water drips from the hanging plant, it sometime lands on the higher leaves and turns white. May also just be hard water drying, but I'll be careful in either case. Spraying with neem oil does the trick.\n\nUpdate 7/23/21: leaves shriveling and dropping at bottom. Will try to water more frequently, as the other leaves were drooping as well.\n\nPicked up from Gethsemane Garden Center on 7/11/21. \n\nWill die back in the fall. Needs 90 days of dormancy, bringing inside and putting it in a dark plant, or leaving it sheltered outside. Do not bring it in and sit it under grow lights during the dormancy period.  Just be sure to water regularly throughout the growing season and then reduce watering in the fall prior to dormancy. Can tell it is dry when the soil pulls away from the pot. \n\nPrefers full sun with some protection from the North Wind. This edible medium purple fig can take subfreezing temperatures, dying back in the Fall and re-sprouting in the Spring. Plant in warmest, most protected space. Prefers Loamy well drained soil with a PH 6.0 - 6.5. Fertilize in early summer. Plants reach an average height of 3 feet. An excellent candidate for pots. Hails from Sicily.\n\nThe medium sized fruit forms during summer and repines to a delicious sweetness from August until fall frost. Pruning is not usually needed as it will died back in our mid-west climate. However protection from wind during the winter is necessary.",

    "description" : "The String of Hearts (Ceropegia woodii) is a trailing succulent-like plant native to South Africa. The delicate heart-shaped foliage and slender vines can reach up to 12' long in its natural environment, and has earned this plant many nicknames, including Rosary Vine and Sweetheart Vine.\nThe String of Hearts plant has a succulent-like nature, so they prefer periods of drought between waterings. When the soil is dry 2/3 of the way down in the pot, then the plant is ready for a drink. In the winter months it’s best to allow the soil to dry completely through the pot as these plants go into a dormancy, even indoors. They are sensitive to root rot and overwatering, so when in doubt let it drought.\n\nHow can I tell if I am underwatering my String of Hearts?\nString of Hearts plants store water in their leaves, so a good indicator to watch for is the leaves beginning to soften and look a little wilted and deflated.\n\nHow can I tell if I have overwatered my plant?\nOverwatering tends to result in yellowing of the leaves and eventually leaf loss. If you suspect you have overwatered your plant, aerate, hold off on watering until the soil has fully dried — potentially up to a month — then refer to the care guide to get back on to a proper watering routine.\n\nhttps://greeneryunlimited.co/pages/string-of-hearts-care",

    "description" : "The tiger aloe plant (Gonialoe variegata), also known by the colorful name partridge-breasted aloe, is native to South Africa and Namibia. Despite its limited native regions, it has become a popular houseplant in many parts of the world. It's an evergreen succulent, making it a very valuable specimen for growing indoors in cold regions.\n\nLight\nIn full sun, your tiger aloe may take on some reddish-brown coloring, adding to its vibrant beauty. But it is also happy in a partial sun setting. If the plant turns brownish-red quickly, give it some water as this can also be a sign of drought.\n\nSoil\nIn its native habitats, tiger aloe plants flourish in rocky outcroppings. So they're not fussy at all about soil, except for requiring excellent drainage. A sandy, semi-dry loam mixture is perfect. Placing pebbles in the base of the container is a good method for ensuring drainage.\n\nWater\nAs with other succulents, which store moisture inside their fleshy leaves, the tiger aloe will benefit from occasional watering only when the soil becomes dry to the touch. At that point, water deeply. It doesn't like to be wet or to have moist soil, so apart from watering as needed, no additional indoor moisture is required. If you have your tiger aloe indoors, keep it away from your humidifier, kitchen or bathroom, and don't put it near other plant arrangements that have trays of water for added humidity.\n\nAn unglazed clay container will help regulate the moisture content. This mimics the rainfall that provides the plant's main source of water in its native habitats.",

    "description" : "Euphorbia Tirucalli is native to Africa but is widely distributed in different parts of the world. It is known by common names such as Sticks on Fire or Firesticks, Pencil cactus, and Pencil tree. Euphorbia Tirucalli has pencil-thin stems that turn a fire-red color during the colder months.\n\nThe stems’ color can range from red, orange, yellow and green depending on the season and temperature. The plant can grow tall and tree-like, up to around 8-10 ft. (2.4-3 m.) tall. The sap of the plant is toxic and can cause severe irritations so care is needed when handling this plant.\n\nTry to provide at least 5-6 hours of sunlight per day indoors so the plant receives enough light. For areas with inadequate indoor lighting or poor lighting conditions, consider using a grow light.\n\nhttps://succulentplantcare.com/euphorbia-tirucalli-firesticks-care-propagation-toxicity/",

Portulacaria afra needs less frequent watering during its dormancy period.\n\nBecause the leaves on Portulacaria afra are so thin, it can handle more frequent waterings than other succulents.\n\nWhere to Plant\nPortulacaria afra is not cold hardy, so if you live in a zone that gets colder than 30° F (1.7° C), it's best to plant this succulent in a container that can be brought indoors. It does well in full to partial sun. Plant in an area of your garden that gets 6 hours of sunlight a day.\n\nIf planting indoors, place it in a sunny window. This succulent tends to stretch easily if not given enough sunlight, however the stretching isn't as noticeable as other succulents.",

    "description" : "Peperomia Graveolens is an ornamental succulent houseplant that is a beautiful addition to any in-home nursery such as the Peperomia Obtusifolia and the Peperomia Prostrata. They are hardy and attractive and although they look delicate, they are easy enough to care for even for a novice houseplant owner.\n\nThey originally hail from the dry regions of Ecuador but now live all over the tropical and subtropical South American regions. These plants are an excellent choice for filling a small spot on a shelf or desk as they are not large, and they don’t drop leaves or make a mess as some houseplants do. They are generally low maintenance so even if they are left on a desk at your office, they will most likely do well. They can be put in pots or used in terrariums and dish gardens with other succulents.\n\nThe nicknames of the Peperomia Graveolens are Ruby Glow and Radiator Plant. These plants do flower however they are prized for their ornamental foliage, not their flowers. The flowers are tiny and grow on long racemes. They are yellowish-white in color.",

    "description" : "Lithops plants are often called “living stones” but they also look a bit like cloven hooves. These small, split succulents are native to the deserts of South Africa but are commonly sold in garden centers and nurseries. Lithops thrive in compacted, sandy soil with little water and blistering hot temperatures. While relatively easy to grow, a little information on lithops will help you learn how to grow living stone plants so that they thrive in your home.\n\nThere are numerous colorful names for plants in the Lithops genus. Pebble plants, mimicry plants, flowering stones, and of course, living stones are all descriptive monikers for a plant that has a unique form and growth habit. Lithops are small plants, rarely getting more than an inch (2.5 cm.) above the soil surface and usually with only two leaves. The thick, padded leaves resemble the cleft in an animal’s foot or just a pair of green- to grayish-brown stones clustered together. The plants have no true stem and much of the plant is underground. The resulting appearance has the double attribute of confusing grazing animals and conserving moisture. Lithops Succulent Adaptations Lithops grow in inhospitable areas with limited water and nutrients. Because the majority of the plant’s body is below ground, it has minimal foliar space to gather the sun’s energy. As a result, the plant has developed a unique way of enhancing solar collection by means of “windowpanes” on the surface of the leaf. These transparent areas are filled with calcium oxalate, which creates a reflective facet that increases light penetration.",

    "description" : "As terrestrial orchids, these plants grow in soil and if you choose to cultivate them they should be kept in a pot. Notably, there also exist a few variants of Ludisia. ‘Alba’, which is an albino, is pale, while ‘Nigrescens’ is a deep black. Though extremely beautiful, these plants are rarely grown outside Asia, and you’d probably need to either consult a specialty source or travel a long distance to find one. But if you are interested in growing Ludisia plants, note that their natural conditions are in tropical forests with extremely hot and humid conditions, so only attempt to grow them if you can mimic the amniotic warmth they need to succeed.\n\n\nThey flower annually, assuming they’ve been well-fed and kept, and the flowers last about a month or so before they die back. With their subtle, lovely colors, these plants make a great addition to any collection of tropical orchids, especially in a shade house.",

    "description" : "he ghost plant is that plant you see everywhere, but didn't know what it was called. With its pinkish-grey succulent leaves and trailing rosette form, ghost plants add a modern touch to container plantings and rock gardens. The ghost plant is a frequent subject of faux plant arrangements, but there's no reason to buy expensive fake plants when the live specimen is so easy to grow and propagate.\n\nLight\nGhost plants will be at their most handsome or full sun or bright dappled shade. Plants that don't receive enough light will be leggy, and may experience leaf drop. When growing as a houseplant, keep the ghost plant in a south or east-facing window.\n\nThe amount of light a ghost plant receives can affect its coloration, which can cause plants of the same species to look like different varieties. A shadier locale will result in the characteristic bluish-gray foliage, while a full day of sun causes shades of blush to appear on leaves.\n\nSoil\nLike the majority of succulents, the ghost plant needs good drainage to maintain a healthy root system. The more rainfall your area receives, the more drainage you must provide for ghost plants. If your garden has clay soil, use raised beds at least six inches tall and a planting mix with half grit, gravel, or sand, and half organic material like peat, coco coir, or commercial potting soil.\n\nWater\nIn the absence of natural rain, ghost plants only need occasional irrigation. Plants growing outdoors in full sun and summer temperatures will appreciate a weekly drink, while houseplants may only need watering every other week. Water indoor ghost plants at soil level to prevent water from stagnating in the rosettes.\n\nTemperature and Humidity\nGhost plants thrive in hot weather, but excess humidity is a problem in areas with poorly draining soil. Planting your ghost plants in containers or raised beds, as well as spacing them away from each other and away from other plants to increase air circulation will keep plants healthy.",

Awl cactus belongs to the Austrocylindropuntia group\n\nIn the wild, Eve’s Pin can reach a height of 12’ feet and a width of 5’ feet. When kept as a houseplant or container plant, its size is naturally limited. This unusual and attractive cactus grows in a tree-like formation. These leaves are edible and are sold as vegetables in many South American locations and Mexican markets in the United States. \n\nAs with most cactus, it’s best to water thoroughly and then allow the soil to dry out completely before watering again. Water well throughout the growing season making sure the plant has plenty of good drainage so it is never standing in water. Water extremely sparingly during the late fall and winter months. In the wintertime, it’s best to keep Eve’s Needle dry. Furthermore, during the growing season, refrain from watering on very humid or cloudy days.",

Keep temperatures between 61°F (16°C ) and 95°F (35°C) and water 1-3 times a week once the soil becomes dry to the touch.  Keep humidity at 70-80%, for the best results. ",

    "description" : "The Mexican Heather plants have beautiful lavenders like flowers and dark green leaves. The plants can reach up to 3 feet in height and can cover 2.5 feet wide. The stem grows a large number of branches. These branches surround the stem and are covered with a large number of leaves and flowers during the bloom season.\n\nThe Mexican Heather plants grow very well in the Southern Parts of the United States, as well as other areas where the temperatures are hot. They do not like the cold and need protection if they are planted in the colder areas, you can keep them indoors to protect them from cold and frost. They are evergreen and retain their leaves all year long, but in cold areas, they sometimes shed a few leaves but still retain a large number of leaves and maintain their green appearance.\n\nThe Mexican Heather plants are easy to grow in their natural environments and where the temperatures are moderately hot and they can receive an abundance of sunlight. But in the cold region, they need a little extra care, you must keep them indoors during the winter in cold areas to protect them from the frost and extreme cold.\n\nThey grow very well in many different soils but they show faster growth in a nutrient-rich slightly sandy and well-draining soil. If the soil you have is not good or lacks the required nutrients, you can add fertilizers to compensate for this. In indoor environments, keep them in a bright place so they can receive enough light.\n\nThe Mexican Heather plants require a consistent water supply. They are small plants and also have small roots that cannot obtain water from the deep soil if they are grown in the ground, that is why consistent and frequent watering will help them grow properly. Another reason for consistent and frequent watering is that they are mostly grown in the hot and dry areas.\n\nKeep watering them once every second day, unless the winter arrives or the plant reaches a height of almost 1 foot. In winter, increase the amount of water per watering but decrease the frequency of watering to once every 5th or 6th day.",

The long stems can grow up to 10 ft. (3 m) long, and they grow heart-shaped leaves.\n\nWhen growing in pots indoors, the satin pothos has trailing stems up to 3 ft. (0.9 m) long. With regular pruning, satin pothos plants can make excellent potted plants with bushy foliage. Or, you can hang them in a basket in a bright location.\n\n\nPart of the scientific name of the silver satin pothos—pictus—literally means painted. This refers to the variegation of silver dots and blotches on the matte green foliage.\n\nThere are many species of plants called pothos. However, true types of pothos are from the genus Epipremnum, for example the golden pothos /devil’s ivy (Epipremnum aureum).\n\ndevils ivy\nThe golden pothos (Epipremnum aureum) is a true type of pothos plant which comes from the genus Epipremnum\n\nSatin Pothos vs. Philodendron Silver\nThe satin pothos is almost identical to the Philodendron silver plant; however, they are a different species. Both plants have long trailing vines, heart-shaped leaves, and silver variegation. Mix-ups also occur because sometimes, the common names for these plants are used interchangeably.\n\nHowever, the satin pothos (Scindapsus pictus) is neither a type of Philodendron nor a type of Epipremnum (common pothos plants). The confusion arose because the satin pothos used to be classified in the genus Epipremnum and the common name ‘pothos’ stuck.\n\n\nTypes of Satin Pothos (Scindapsus pictus)\nsilver satin 'Exotica'\nIn this picture: Scindapsus pictus ‘Exotica’\n\nThere are a few different Scindapsus pictus cultivars to choose from. All of them have variations in variegation that affect the number of silver markings on the leaves. Generally, to care for satin pothos with lighter leaves, you should place them in a brighter location.\n\nThe three main satin pothos types to choose from are: Scindapsus pictus ‘Argyraeus’ with sparse silver variegation, the Scindapsus pictus ‘Exotica’ that has heavier variegation that looks like silver splashes, and the Scindapsus pictus ‘Silver Ann’ that has silver pothos leaves.\n\nHow to Care for Silver Satin Pothos (Scindapsus pictus)\nLet’s look in more detail at how to look after a satin pothos at home. This guide includes tips on how often to water a pothos, when to repot the plant, and how to propagate them.\n\n\nLight Requirements for Silver Pothos (Scindapsus pictus)\nSatin pothos plants need plenty of bright, indirect sunlight to thrive. The best location for this hanging potted plant is in near an east- or west-facing window where it gets some morning or evening sun. Avoid placing the silver leaf pothos in the sun’s direct rays to avoid scorching them.\n\nSilver pothos is a plant that you can grow in low-light conditions. However, you may find that the plant’s vines become sparse and leggy and look unkempt. The lack of adequate light may also cause the silver variegation to lose its vibrancy. If you notice that leaves of your scindapsus pictus become darker, move it to a brighter location to encourage faster growth.\n\nThe minimum temperature for silver pothos houseplants is 60°F (15°C). So, you can grow pothos plants outdoors as long as it’s sunny and the temperature is above 65°F (18°C). Place the scindapsus pictus plant pot in a bright location where it gets filtered sunlight. Avoid placing on a deck, patio, or windowsill where it’s in direct sunlight all day.\n\nBest Soil for Growing Silver Satin Pothos\nSatin pothos (Scindapsus pictus) needs to grow in a rich, well-draining potting mix. The best type of potting medium should have organic matter to hold moisture but be light enough so that water drains freely. The plant’s growth will slow down if it grows in soggy, waterlogged soil.\n\nIt is easy to make a suitable potting medium for growing silver satin pothos. You should mix equal parts of potting soil, peat moss, and perlite. Instead of perlite, you could add charcoal pieces or coco coir chips to help increase drainage. The peat moss keeps the soil moist so that the roots get nourished.\n\nThe best way to know if the soil is light enough is to water it thoroughly. If the water pools on the soil surface or takes a while to drain, you should aerate the soil. Alternatively, if the soil drains too quickly and you have to water the satin pothos more often, add more sphagnum peat moss.\n\n\nHow to Water Satin Pothos Houseplant\nYou should water satin pothos as often as the top part of the soil dries out. In summer, the scindapsus pictus plant may need watering as often as twice a week or more. In winter, the silver leaf pothos requires less frequent watering. The goal of watering is to make sure that the roots are always slightly moist.\n\nTo check when to water your pothos plants, firmly press on the potting soil to check for moisture. If there are hints of dampness, leave for a few days until the top part of the soil dries completely. You can also check the pot’s drainage holes—the soil at that end should be slightly damp.\n\nHow often you water your satin pothos depends on several factors such as:\n\nAir temperature—You will need to water your scindapsus pictus plant less often in winter than in summer. Plants respire less in cold months and give off less moisture. In summer, check the plant every few days to see if it needs watering.\nType of pot—Soil in terracotta pots evaporates faster than potting mix in plastic or ceramic pots. So, satin pothos growing in unglazed clay pots may need watering more frequently.\nType of soil—The soil density will impact how often your plant requires hydration.\nThe best advice for watering houseplants is to check that the top 2” (5 cm) of soil is completely dry. Then give the plant a thorough watering.\n\nTo thoroughly water your pothos, pour enough filtered water or rainwater until it drains out the bottom. This watering technique ensures that the roots get enough hydration to stay healthy. Allowing the plant’s soil to partially dry between waterings helps make sure roots don’t become soggy and diseased. You also avoid problems of fungus gnats and white mold on plant soil—issues that afflict houseplants when the top part of the soil is constantly damp.\n\nThe Best Indoor Temperature for Scindapsus Pictus\nSatin pothos plants experience the best growth in a temperature range of 65°F to 85°F (18°C – 29°C). Constant average room temperature is similar to their native tropical environment. To grow well, protect the plants from sudden changes in temperature.\n\n\nIt can be challenging to get the right temperature in summer or winter. For example, the plant’s growth could slow down if it’s too close to hot radiators in the winter. Also, cold drafts could cause its beautiful green and silver leaves to wilt, curl, and turn brown. In the summertime, temperature issues could be caused by hot sun beating through windows or cold airflow from the air conditioning.",

    "description" : "Also called Confederate jasmine, star jasmine (Trachelospermum jasminoides) is a vine that produces highly fragrant, white blossoms that attract bees. Native to China and Japan, it does very well in California and the southern U.S., where it provides excellent ground cover and climbing decoration. Keep reading to learn about growing star jasmine vine in your garden. \n\nGardeners in warm climates (USDA Zones 8-10) can grow star jasmine as ground cover, where it will overwinter. This is ideal, as star jasmine can be slow to grow at first and may take some time to get established. Once mature, it will reach a height and spread of 3 to 6 feet (1-2 m.). Prune any upward reaching shoots to maintain an even height. In addition to ground cover, star jasmine plants climb well and can be trained to grow on trellises, doorways, and posts to make for beautiful, fragrant decorations. In areas any cooler than Zone 8, you should plant your star jasmine in a pot that can be brought inside during the colder months, or treat it as an annual. Once it gets going, it will bloom most in the spring, with more sporadic blooming throughout the summer. The blossoms are pure white, pinwheel shaped, and beautifully perfumed.",
